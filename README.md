# React Expenses Tracker

As I'm currently learning React, this project was an introduction into it.

I learned about components, states, React hooks, two way binding as well as ES6.

This project covered the basics of creating a React App without re-rendering the DOM as well as an introduction to Node.js and React deployments

You can view the deployed version here: https://nothile-moyo-git.github.io/expenses-tracker/
