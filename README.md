This project is an introduction into React.js

I learned about components, states, React hooks, two way binding as well as ES6.

This project covered the basics of creating a React App without re-rendering the DOM as well as an introduction to deploying React Apps on GitHub pages and improving my working understanding of Git.

This was inspired by GraphQL.
